![30 Days Of API Testing Challenge Goals](30DaysOfAPITestingChecklist.png)

## Day 1
Found a defintion of API testing: “API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.” 

## Day 2
For API exploratory testing I'd use Postman, the course I started on it seems like a good idea now.
