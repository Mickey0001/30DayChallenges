![30 Days Of API Testing Challenge Badge](30_Days_of_API_Testing_Images_BADGE.png)

## Day 1
Found a defintion of API testing: ‚ÄúAPI testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.‚Äù 

## Day 2
For API exploratory testing I'd use Postman, the course I started on it seems like a good idea now.

## Day 3
I started reading a book on API testing, by Alan Richardson, the dude behind the Evil Tester podcast, the name ain't "good" but the content is! üòÄ

## Day 4
I really like the MDN's explanation of HTTP protocol, so here it is: [MDN - An Overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

## Day 5
Here's a few [publicly available API's](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis) that can be used for learning purposes.

## Day 6
Today I read an interesting blog post with 10 tips for API testing, [here it is](https://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/api-testing-tips).

## Day 7
Made a GET and POST request, yea I'm an expert! üòÜ

## Day 8
Checked out the [API forum thread](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/all-testing-talk/api) over at MoT and kept reading the book about API's I started a few days ago.

## Day 9
To discover the API calls our app is making we can use tools such as Fiddler.

## Day 10
My favorite API testing tools are Postman and Fiddler, because they're pretty intuitive and easy to use.

## Day 11
There are several [different types of API](https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/Types-of-APIs)

## Day 12
For a team to succeed in API testing they need:
- Good overall testing skills
- Programming knowledge 
- Database knowledge
- Use of tools like Postman, Swagger, Fiddler SoapUI, etc.

## Day 13
Some of the tools (I used only Postman, thus far) that can be used for API automation are: 
- SoapUI
- Katalon Studio
- Postman
- Tricentis Tosca
- Apigee
- JMeter (mostly used for load testing, though)
- Rest-Assured
- Assertible
- Karate DSL

## Day 14
- Mock: an object on which you set expectations
- Stub: Similar to mock, but it doesn't provide the ability to verify that the method has been called.
- Fake: a class the implements an interface, but has no fixed data or logic.

## Day 15
Today I tried a new API tool, a Chrome extension: Talend API Tester - Free Edition.

## Day 16
Started writing little API tests, in Postman, using JavaScript.

## Day 17
I found 5 API testing experts on Twitter to follow:
- @GregPaskal
- @AutomationSbS 
- @ptrthomas 
- @mittsh 
- @honzajavorek 

## Day 18
A bit on HTTP headers:
- authority : the host/domain or the request
- method : POST method.
- path : relative path of content.
- accept : certain media types which are acceptable for the response.
- accept-encoding: similar to accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response
- accept-language : set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request
- content-length : the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would 
- have been sent, had the request been a GET
- content-type : indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient
- cookie : contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL
- user-agent : contains information about the user agent originating the request
- Form Data - timings: The responded time from API(milisecond)
