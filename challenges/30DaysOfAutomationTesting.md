# # 30DaysOfAutomationInTesting
30 Days Of Automation in Testing challenge, checklist with the goals is available [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/30-days-of-testing/lessons/30-days-of-automation-in-testing).

## Day 1
- Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. 
- Test Automation uses special software tools to automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.

## Day 2
Started reading a book by Mark Fewster & Dorothy Graham, labeled: "Software test automation" it's almost 600 pages long, hopefully I'll be able to finish it by day 30.

## Day 3
Explored and participated in the forum (The Club) [thread on automation](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/all-testing-talk/automation) at the Ministry of Testing.

## Day 4
Read about what kind of types of tests can be automated, I knew most of this stuff but it's always got to hear different opinions - being narrow minded in IT is the dumbest thing you can be. ðŸ¤“

## Day 5
I've used Selenium and it's IDE, for UI automation. Tests recorded with Selenium IDE can be brittle and not very maintainable in the long term, but it's useful for getting the XPaths, the browser's DOM explorer can be used for this as well.

## Day 6
To success in automation testing a team needs to: 
- Be good at manual testing
- Have good coding skills
- Be strong in domain knowledge
- Know how to use automation tools
- Understand the Automation Testing Life Cycle
- Create a test automation strategy
- Stay updated on industry trends

## Day 7
How to choose which tools to use in testing? 
1. Identify your requirements 
2. Evaluate the tools and vendors 
3. Estimate cost and the benefits 
4. Make the final decision

## Day 8
I showed a non-technical person how to execute automated tests using the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

## Day 9
[Swagger](https://swagger.io/blog/api-development/getting-started-with-swagger-i-what-is-swagger/) is an open-source software framework used for desigining, buidling, documenting and consuming RESTful web services.

## Day 10
Deleted a few duplicate lines of code in my unit test, moved a few checks to a separate test in order to tidy things up a bit. Hearing about the broken window theory, on the @ABT_Podcast nudged me to do it.
