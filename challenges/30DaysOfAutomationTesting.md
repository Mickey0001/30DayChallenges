# # 30DaysOfAutomationInTesting
30 Days Of Automation in Testing challenge, checklist with the goals is available [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/30-days-of-testing/lessons/30-days-of-automation-in-testing).

## Day 1
- Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. 
- Test Automation uses special software tools to automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.

## Day 2
Started reading a book by Mark Fewster & Dorothy Graham, labeled: "Software test automation" it's almost 600 pages long, hopefully I'll be able to finish it by day 30.

## Day 3
Explored and participated in the forum (The Club) [thread on automation](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/all-testing-talk/automation) at the Ministry of Testing.

## Day 4
Read about what kind of types of tests can be automated, I knew most of this stuff but it's always got to hear different opinions - being narrow minded in IT is the dumbest thing you can be. ðŸ¤“

## Day 5
I've used Selenium and it's IDE, for UI automation. Tests recorded with Selenium IDE can be brittle and not very maintainable in the long term, but it's useful for getting the XPaths, the browser's DOM explorer can be used for this as well.
