# # 30DaysOfAutomationInTesting
30 Days Of Automation in Testing challenge, checklist with the goals is available [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/30-days-of-testing/lessons/30-days-of-automation-in-testing).

## Day 1
- Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. 
- Test Automation uses special software tools to automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.

## Day 2
Started reading a book by Mark Fewster & Dorothy Graham, labeled: "Software test automation" it's almost 600 pages long, hopefully I'll be able to finish it by day 30.

## Day 3
Explored and participated in the forum (The Club) [thread on automation](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/c/all-testing-talk/automation) at the Ministry of Testing.

## Day 4
Read about what kind of types of tests can be automated, I knew most of this stuff but it's always got to hear different opinions - being narrow minded in IT is the dumbest thing you can be. ü§ì

## Day 5
I've used Selenium and it's IDE, for UI automation. Tests recorded with Selenium IDE can be brittle and not very maintainable in the long term, but it's useful for getting the XPaths, the browser's DOM explorer can be used for this as well.

## Day 6
To success in automation testing a team needs to: 
- Be good at manual testing
- Have good coding skills
- Be strong in domain knowledge
- Know how to use automation tools
- Understand the Automation Testing Life Cycle
- Create a test automation strategy
- Stay updated on industry trends

## Day 7
How to choose which tools to use in testing? 
1. Identify your requirements 
2. Evaluate the tools and vendors 
3. Estimate cost and the benefits 
4. Make the final decision

## Day 8
I showed a non-technical person how to execute automated tests using the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

## Day 9
[Swagger](https://swagger.io/blog/api-development/getting-started-with-swagger-i-what-is-swagger/) is an open-source software framework used for desigining, buidling, documenting and consuming RESTful web services.

## Day 10
Deleted a few duplicate lines of code in my unit test, moved a few checks to a separate test in order to tidy things up a bit. Hearing about the broken window theory, on the @ABT_Podcast nudged me to do it. 

## Day 11
I already did this - compare and contrast Mocking,Stubbing and Faking, as a part of 30 day of API testing, but if someone is interested [here it is](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/30-days-of-automation-in-testing-day-11-compare-and-contrast-mocking-stubbing-and-faking/16699).

## Day 12
I read an interesting [blog on test automation today](https://www.eviltester.com/blog/eviltester/quora/2019-02-25-what-is-easier).

## Day 13
My favorite automation tool is: Visual Studio - Enterprise Edition! Why? Because it's like a Star Destroy, it's packed with wide arsenal of features, lot of them very useful in test automation - with test explorer being the most obvious one.

## Day 14
Find 5 automation experts to follow on Twitter:
@Toinedotcom 
@jlipps 
@PeetRonics 
@magda0s 
@DolinskiAndrzej 

## Day 15
I've done some research on Protractor, I plan to use it for the UI test suite when I finally decide to re-do my portfolio in Angular - I made myself and epic with two feature stories in Azure DevOps, it's a start.

## Day 16
The most valuable piece of automation being used by your team is an extensive automated regression suite that's cover several inter-dependent systems, I can't go into specifics, NDA's and whatnot. ü§ì

## Day 17
 Advice For People Getting Started:
- Don't neglect business logic and/or manual testing
- Understand the problem 
- Choose a tool
- Have a decent understating of programming

## Day 18
[How to do mock for your unittests in C#](https://youtu.be/DwbYxP-etMY) 

## Day 19
Today I read an interesting blog on [testability](https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/knowledge-is-power-when-it-comes-to-software-testa).

## Day  20
Visually, my current test in my learning project work something like [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Hierons/publication/241630975/figure/fig1/AS:393275971260433@1470775706548/CFG-of-unit-testing.png).

## Day  21
I tried making my unit test execute faster by spiting one test into four smaller ones.

## Day  22
My biggest frustration with automation testing is that I still don't know how much exactly I don't know about it. ü§™

## Day  23
Lately I've been reading about Applitools, a visual UI, AI assisted testing tool, a QA presentation at an internal company meetup peeked my interest about it. I think I'll give that trial a "trial" as soon as I find time. üßê

## Day  24
I'm not doing much automation at the moment in my team (I work on investigating prod issues) as most of the scenarios have been covered by regression. We sometimes do automate tests for certain edge cases.

## Day  25
Actions take before automating tests:
-Write the manual test case
-Try to use web services when possible instead of fully automating the UI, as UI test are the slowest ones
-Send for peer review and code review afterwards 

## Day  26
For mobile testing I've used Browserstack in the past as it offers the ability to test using real remote physical devices, aside from that I'd love to give Appium a try one day as well. 

## Day  27
For automation we use
- NUnit for the regression suite
- C# for the automation framework 
- Visual Studio for writing and debugging tests
- TeamCity for the CI/CD pipeline
- Xray Jira plugin for test cases

## Day  28
For this part of the challenge I'll send some of the unit test I wrote to a fellow developer for review.
